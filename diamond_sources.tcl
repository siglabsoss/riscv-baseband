# If you have a pre-compiled IP you need to also append to the path to .ngo file directory to the macro_search_path variable.

# Example: append macro_search_path "$abs_path/path_to_ip_ngo;" (NOTE THE ; AT THE END OF THE PATH!)

# DON'T FORGET to pre-pend $abs_path to the path to your sources
# DON'T FORGET the ; at the end of the path to your pre-compiled IP .ngo file directory
